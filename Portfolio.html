          <p>There is disclosed in the present specification a mobile telephone in which a cartilage conduction unit for making contact with the ear cartilage is provided to at least one of two corner parts at an upper side of the mobile telephone. Further
            disclosed is a mobile telephone comprising a surface of an outer wall and a cartilage conduction vibration source arranged inward from the surface of the outer wall, the vibration of the cartilage conduction vibration source being transmitted
            to the surface of the outer wall, wherein when the surface of the outer wall is brought into contact with at least a part of the ear cartilage around the entrance part to the external auditory meatus without making contact with the auricular
            helix, the sound pressure inside the external auditory meatus at about 1 cm from the entrance part of the external auditory meatus has an at least 10 dB increase compared to the non-contact state. Further disclosed is a mobile telephone comprising:
            a telephone function unit; a cartilage conduction vibration source; an application processor for controlling the telephone function unit; a power management unit for supplying a plurality of different voltages to the telephone function unit;
            a drive circuit for driving the cartilage conduction vibration source on the basis of the power supplied from the power management unit; and a controller for controlling the power management unit and the drive circuit on the basis of an instruction
            from the application processor; the power management unit, the drive circuit, and the controller being configured as a single-chip integrated circuit.</p>

          <p>Heat pump system</p>
          <p>A refrigerant circuit includes a compressor, a heat source-side heat exchanger, and a usage-side heat exchanger capable of heating an aqueous medium. An aqueous medium circuit includes a circulation pump and the usage-side heat exchanger, and
            is connected to aqueous medium devices. An auxiliary heat source is provided at an outlet side of the usage-side heat exchanger in the aqueous medium circuit to further heat the aqueous medium. A heating capability computation unit computes
            a heating capability of the aqueous medium devices based on an operating state quantity of constituent devices or refrigerant flowing through the refrigerant circuit. A circulation flow rate computation unit computes a circulation flow rate
            of the aqueous medium based on an outlet/inlet temperature difference and the heating capability. A prediction unit predicts an outlet temperature of the aqueous medium in the auxiliary heat source based on the circulation flow rate and heat
            source capability information.</p>

          <p>Film exposure method</p>
          <p>On a film where an exposure material coating has been formed in a exposure pattern formation region on a film base material, a colored firing material, colored light-curable material, or colored ink is applied to at least one of two widthwise
            side edges to form a side part application coating, which is irradiated with laser light by an alignment mark formation unit to form an alignment mark. The alignment mark is then used to detect film meandering and adjust the positions of masks.
            This makes it easy to form the alignment mark and detect the alignment mark thus formed and makes it possible to accurately correct for meandering of a film and stably expose the film in the process of continuous exposure of a film where an
            exposure material coating has been formed in a exposure pattern formation region on a film base material.</p>

          <p>Ventricular Fibrillation Caused by Traumatic Coronary Artery Dissection</p>
          <p>Coronary artery dissection due to blunt chest trauma (traumatic coronary artery dissection [TCAD]) may heal spontaneously, and some surgeons believe that conservative or elective treat-ments are sufficient, provided that there are no progressing
            ischemic symptoms. However, we report a patient who experienced sudden ventricular fibrillation (VF) during initial medical care for trauma injuries. The 32-year-old woman was riding in a passenger car when an accident occurred, and was subsequently
            transported to our emergency department. Twelve-lead electrocardiography revealed ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, although her vital signs remained stable. Therefore, we prioritized assessing the trauma at other sites, and
            VF suddenly occurred. Coronary angiography was performed with repeated defibrillation and chest compressions, which resulted in recovery of spontaneous circulation. Occlusion was observed in the right coronary artery, which we treated with
            balloon angioplasty. However, intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) subsequently revealed coronary artery dissection, a stent was placed, and the patient successfully recovered. Therefore, IVUS may be useful for diagnosing TCAD, and swift intervention
            is needed if TCAD is detected.</p>
