Welcome to a simple version of Frogger, courtesy of the Udacity FEND!
I (Spencer) have written a portion of the code for this game to practice my
Javascript skills, so I hope you enjoy it.

You will be represented on this screen by the little boy at the bottom-center
of the start screen. You can move him using the arrow keys on your keyboard –
'UP' moves him up by one tile, 'LEFT' moves him left by one tile, etc.
You will not be able to move beyond the edges of the game.

Now comes the hard part! Your goal is get from the bottom of the screen to the
top (the water is 'safe', or something...). Once you do that, the game will
reset, allowing you to play it again and again as many times as you want.
However, the game has been designed to reset your progress if you get hit
by one of the four enemies that are constantly crossing your path. You will
need to carefully time your movements to make sure you don't get hit.
To keep things extra-interesting, a new enemy will be added each time you
successfully reach the top of the screen!

Hope you'll have fun playing this game – good luck!
