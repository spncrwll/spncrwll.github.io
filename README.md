Hello! My name is Spencer Walle. I'm an experienced freelance translator
who's looking to break into the world of computer programming.
I'm interested in front-end web development; later on, I'd like to expand
my skills to include Android app development.
This combination résumé/portfolio is my chance to showcase some of the things
I've learned while working on a Front-end Web Development Nanodegree with
Udacity. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any inquiries or suggestions!
